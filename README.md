# SecureMessagingSystem-Group3-COMP485


This project is a chat system that provides simple message encryption. The
system consists of two components, the client and the server. The server is the
core of the system because all connections and messages are passed through
it. The client is similar to programs such as AOL instant messenger or Yahoo
messenger. It provides the capabilities of both public and group chat, and instant
messaging. Also, a buddy list lets you know which users are online at any given
time.
